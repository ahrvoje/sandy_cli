## What is Sandy?

Sandy launches executables inside a kernel-enforced Windows sandbox — no elevation required. Two isolation modes are supported: [AppContainer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/appcontainer-isolation) (the same technology used by UWP apps and Edge) and **Restricted Token** (restricting SIDs with configurable integrity level). All settings are configured explicitly via TOML — no hidden defaults.

No VMs, Docker, WSL, or Hyper-V — just a single native executable. Sandy is lean, unprivileged sandboxing for agentic AI workflows, automation scripts, and tool-use pipelines: you define exactly which folders, files, and network access the process gets.

### Key Features

- 🔒 **Dual sandbox modes** — AppContainer or Restricted Token with configurable integrity
- 📁 **Granular access control** — read, write, execute, append, delete, or full access per file or folder
- 🌐 **Network control** — internet, LAN, and localhost independently configurable (AppContainer)
- 🛡️ **Explicit configuration** — all settings mandatory, no hidden defaults or implicit behavior
- ⏱️ **Resource limits** — timeout, memory cap, and process count limits
- 📝 **Audit logging** — session logs, Procmon-based denial auditing, and crash dumps
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — single native executable, no runtime needed

## Usage

```
sandy.exe -c <config.toml> [-l <logfile>] [-a <auditlog>] [-d <dumpfile>] [-L] [-q] -x <executable> [args...]
sandy.exe -s "<toml>"      [-l <logfile>] [-a <auditlog>] [-d <dumpfile>] [-L] [-q] -x <executable> [args...]
sandy.exe -p <report>       -x <executable> [args...]
sandy.exe --print-container-toml          (print default appcontainer config)
sandy.exe --print-restricted-toml         (print default restricted config)
sandy.exe --cleanup                       (restore stale state from crashed runs)
sandy.exe --status                        (show active instances and stale state)
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c <path>`, `--config <path>` | Path to TOML config file |
| `-s <toml>`, `--string <toml>` | Inline TOML config string (alternative to `-c`) |
| `-l <path>`, `--log <path>` | Session log (config, output, exit code) |
| `-a <path>`, `--audit <path>` | Audit log of denied resource access (requires Procmon + admin) |
| `-d <path>`, `--dump <path>` | Crash dump output path (independent of `-a`) |
| `-L`, `--log-stamp` | Prepend `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_uid_` to log/audit/dump filenames |
| `-p <path>`, `--profile <path>` | Profile unsandboxed run for sandbox feasibility (requires Procmon + admin) |
| `-x <path>`, `--exec <path>` | Executable to run sandboxed (consumes remaining args) |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | Suppress the config banner on stderr |
| `-v`, `--version` | Print version |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print full help text with config reference |
| `--print-container-toml` | Print default AppContainer config to stdout |
| `--print-restricted-toml` | Print default Restricted Token config to stdout |
| `--cleanup` | Restore stale state from crashed runs (loopback, ACLs, WER, scheduled task) |
| `--status` | Show active sandy instances, stale grants, and scheduled task |

All sandy flags must come **before** `-x`. Arguments after `-x <executable>` are forwarded to it. Sandy forwards the child process's exit code.

---

## Config File

All sandbox behavior is controlled by a TOML config. Every config **must** include a `[sandbox]` section declaring the token mode. Use `-c` or `-s` (mutually exclusive). Mode-specific settings are validated — using a flag meant for the other mode is an error. All paths must be absolute.

See [`sandy_config.toml`](sandy_config.toml) for the default template, [`sandy_config_appcontainer.toml`](sandy_config_appcontainer.toml) and [`sandy_config_restricted.toml`](sandy_config_restricted.toml) for mode-specific templates.

### `[sandbox]` — Mode selection

```toml
[sandbox]
token = 'appcontainer'    # or 'restricted'
integrity = 'low'         # restricted only: 'low' or 'medium' (required)
workdir = 'C:\projects'   # child working directory (default: sandy.exe folder)
```

| Key | Values | Modes | Description |
|-----|--------|-------|-------------|
| `token` | `'appcontainer'`, `'restricted'` | both | Sandbox isolation model *(required)* |
| `integrity` | `'low'`, `'medium'` | restricted | Integrity level *(required)* · `'low'` = strongest isolation, `'medium'` = wider app compatibility |
| `workdir` | path | both | Child process working directory (default: folder containing `sandy.exe`) |

### `[allow]` — File and folder grants

Grant the sandboxed process access to specific files or folders. Sandy modifies folder ACLs at launch and restores them on exit. Requires `WRITE_DAC` on each path (user-owned folders work without admin).

```toml
[allow]
read    = ['C:\data\config.json', 'C:\Python314']
write   = ['C:\logs\agent.log', 'C:\temp\output']
execute = ['C:\tools\bin']
append  = ['C:\logs\audit.log']
delete  = ['C:\temp\scratch']
all     = ['C:\workspace']
```

| Key | Permission granted |
|-----|--------------------|
| `read` | Read files, list directories |
| `write` | Create and modify files (no read) |
| `execute` | Read + execute files, list directories |
| `append` | Append only (no overwrite, no read) |
| `delete` | Delete only |
| `all` | Full access (read + write + execute + delete) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recursive propagation:** Directory grants apply to the path **and all its descendants** — every subdirectory and file underneath inherits the same access level.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Permissions are independent — `write` does **not** grant `read`, and `read` does **not** grant `execute`. Grant each permission explicitly, or use `all` for full access.

### `[deny]` — Deny access to specific paths

Block specific permissions on paths that would otherwise be granted by a broader `[allow]`. Uses the same 6 access keys as `[allow]`. All 6 keys are required (use `[]` for none).

```toml
[deny]
read    = []
write   = ['C:\workspace\src\core']         # block writes in core/ even though workspace has all
execute = []
append  = []
delete  = []
all     = ['C:\workspace\secrets']           # fully block secrets/ even though workspace has all
```

**Key behaviors:**

- **Deny always wins.** If a path appears in both `[allow]` and `[deny]`, the deny takes priority. This is enforced regardless of the order they appear in the config.
- **Deny is recursive.** A deny on a directory blocks the denied permissions on that directory **and all descendants** — subdirectories and files at every depth.
- **Deny is surgical.** Only the specific permission type is blocked. For example, `deny.write` blocks writing and creating files, but `read`, `execute`, and `delete` remain allowed.
- **`deny.write` does NOT block delete.** `DELETE` is a separate Windows permission from `WRITE`. To block deletion, use `deny.delete` or `deny.all`.
- **`deny.read` blocks listing.** Denying read also blocks `os.listdir()` / `dir` because directory listing requires read-data permission.

> [!TIP]
> **Common pattern:** Grant `all` to a workspace root, then deny `write` on specific subdirectories to create read-only zones, or deny `all` on sensitive directories to fully block access.

### `[privileges]` — Permissions

All keys must be explicitly set for the active mode. Omitting a key is a parse error. Wrong-mode keys are rejected.

```toml
# AppContainer mode — all 8 keys required:
[privileges]
system_dirs     = true
network         = false
localhost       = false
lan             = false
stdin           = false
clipboard_read  = false
clipboard_write = false
child_processes = true

# Restricted mode — all 5 keys required:
[privileges]
named_pipes     = false
stdin           = false
clipboard_read  = false
clipboard_write = false
child_processes = true
```

| Key | Required in | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| `system_dirs` | appcontainer | Read access to `C:\Windows`, `Program Files` |
| `network` | appcontainer | Outbound internet access |
| `localhost` | appcontainer | Loopback connections (requires admin) |
| `lan` | appcontainer | Local network access |
| `named_pipes` | restricted | Named pipe creation (`CreateNamedPipeW`) |
| `stdin` | both | `true` = inherit, `false` = disabled (NUL), or a file path |
| `clipboard_read` | both | Allow reading from the clipboard |
| `clipboard_write` | both | Allow writing to the clipboard |
| `child_processes` | both | Allow spawning child processes (kernel-enforced) |

#### What `system_dirs` exposes (AppContainer only)

Enables the `ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES` group, granting **read-only** access to:

| Path | Access |
|------|--------|
| `C:\Windows`, `System32`, `SysWOW64` | ✅ read |
| `C:\Program Files`, `Program Files (x86)` | ✅ read |
| `C:\Windows\Temp`, `ProgramData`, `C:\Users` | ❌ blocked |
| User profile (Desktop, Documents, Downloads) | ❌ blocked |

> [!TIP]
> Python's Windows installer sets `ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES` on its install directory. With `system_dirs = true`, the Python folder is readable without an explicit `[allow]` entry.

### `[registry]` — Registry key grants *(restricted only)*

Grant read or write access to specific registry keys. Most keys under `HKLM\Software` and `HKCU` are already readable by default via `BUILTIN\Users`.

```toml
[registry]
read  = ['HKCU\Software\MyApp']
write = ['HKCU\Software\MyApp\Settings']
```

> [!NOTE]
> `[registry]` is not available in AppContainer mode — AppContainer provides a fixed private registry hive automatically.

### `[environment]` — Environment variables

`inherit` must be explicitly set. When `false`, the child gets a clean environment with only essential Windows variables. Use `pass` to add specific variables.

```toml
[environment]
inherit = true            # pass full parent environment
# or:
inherit = false           # clean env + pass list
pass = ['PATH', 'PYTHONPATH', 'HOME']
```

When `inherit = false`, the following essential Windows vars are always passed:

| Category | Variables |
|----------|-----------|
| System | `SYSTEMROOT`, `SYSTEMDRIVE`, `WINDIR`, `OS` |
| Temp | `TEMP`, `TMP` |
| Shell | `COMSPEC`, `PATHEXT` |
| User dirs | `LOCALAPPDATA`, `APPDATA`, `USERPROFILE`, `HOMEDRIVE`, `HOMEPATH` |
| Hardware | `PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE`, `NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` |

### `[limit]` — Resource constraints

```toml
[limit]
timeout = 300       # kill process after N seconds (exit code 1)
memory = 4096       # job-wide memory cap in MB (all processes combined)
processes = 10      # max total active processes (including main)
```

🔒 fixed · ❌ blocked · ✅ allowed · ⚙️ configurable · ⚠️ warning

¹ Restricted Low writes to medium-integrity folders (most of `C:\Users`) are blocked by mandatory integrity even with `[allow]` grants. Use `AppData\LocalLow` or Restricted Medium for user profile writes.

**Use AppContainer** when you need network isolation and don't require named pipes or COM.

**Use Restricted Token** when the sandboxed app needs named pipes (Flutter, Chromium, Mojo) or COM/RPC.

### Examples

AppContainer with network access:

```toml
[sandbox]
token = 'appcontainer'

[allow]
read = ['C:\Python314', 'C:\projects\my_agent']
all = ['C:\workspace']

[deny]
read    = []
write   = []
execute = []
append  = []
delete  = []
all     = []

[privileges]
system_dirs = true
network = true
localhost = false
lan = false
stdin = false
clipboard_read = false
clipboard_write = false
child_processes = true

[environment]
inherit = false
pass = ['PATH']

[limit]
timeout = 300
memory = 2048
```

```
sandy.exe -c agent_config.toml -x C:\Python314\python.exe agent.py
```

Restricted Token with pipes and medium integrity:

```toml
[sandbox]
token = 'restricted'
integrity = 'medium'

[allow]
read = ['C:\Python314', 'C:\projects\my_agent']
all = ['C:\workspace']

[deny]
read    = []
write   = []
execute = []
append  = []
delete  = []
all     = []

[privileges]
named_pipes = true
stdin = false
clipboard_read = false
clipboard_write = false
child_processes = true

[environment]
inherit = true

[registry]
write = ['HKCU\Software\MyApp\Settings']

[limit]
timeout = 300
```

---

## Audit

The `-a` flag captures resource denial events via [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) (headless). Requires Procmon on PATH + admin. Sandy records all file, registry, network, DLL, and process denials during the child's lifetime, then outputs a deduplicated post-mortem log.

```
sandy.exe -c config.toml -a audit.log -x myapp.exe
```

```
[13:07:38.12] T:4520   FILE    ACCESS DENIED       C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll
[13:07:38.34] T:4520   REG     ACCESS DENIED       HKLM\Software\MyApp

=== Summary: 47 unique events, 38 FILE, 3 REG, 4 NET, 2 IMAGE ===
=== Repeated (x count) ===
  x23  FILE    ACCESS DENIED       C:\Windows\System32
```

---

## Logging

Session logs (`-l`), audit logs (`-a`), and crash dumps (`-d`) write to the path you specify — relative paths resolve against the current working directory (standard POSIX behavior).

**Log rotation:** If the target file already exists and `--log-stamp` is *not* used, Sandy automatically rotates with POSIX-style numbered suffixes:

```
session.log → session.log.1 → session.log.2 → ...
```

**Timestamped logs:** Use `-L` / `--log-stamp` to prepend a unique `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_uid_` prefix to all log filenames. The 4-hex UID prevents collisions when multiple runs start in the same second:

```
sandy.exe -L -l session.log -a audit.log -x myapp.exe
→ 20260305_105426_a3f1_session.log
→ 20260305_105426_a3f1_audit.log
```

All log timestamps use **local time with ISO 8601 UTC offset** (e.g. `2026-03-05T10:54:26.123+01:00`).

---

## Profile

The `-p` flag runs a process **unsandboxed** under [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon), analyzes its resource usage (files, registry, network, DLLs, pipes, child processes), and generates a feasibility report with a suggested TOML config. Requires Procmon on PATH + admin.

```
sandy.exe -p report.txt -x myapp.exe [args...]
```

Use profile mode **before** sandboxing an unfamiliar application. It tells you whether the process can be sandboxed, which mode works best, and what `[allow]` paths and `[privileges]` are needed.

```
--- Verdict ---
Sandboxable:     YES
AppContainer:    YES (recommended)

--- Suggested TOML Config ---
[sandbox]
token = 'appcontainer'
[allow]
read = ['C:\Users', 'C:\repos\myproject']
write = ['C:\Users\H\AppData\Local\Temp']
[privileges]
system_dirs = true
```

---

## Notes

> [!WARNING]
> **AppContainer: strict isolation.** Sandy blocks access to system folders (`C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`) unless `system_dirs = true` is set in `[privileges]`. Most executables need system DLLs to run, so the sample config ships with `system_dirs` enabled. In Restricted Token mode, system directories are always readable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Localhost access** (AppContainer only) requires administrator privileges. Sandy uses `CheckNetIsolation.exe` to manage the loopback exemption. If running without elevation, Sandy prints a warning and continues (localhost will remain blocked).

> [!NOTE]
> **Sandy stderr banner.** Sandy prints a config summary to stderr before running. Use `-q` to suppress it in automation pipelines where stderr is captured.

> [!NOTE]
> **Sandy runs without elevation in most cases.** It modifies folder ACLs to grant the sandbox access, which requires `WRITE_DAC` permission on each configured folder. Users have this permission on folders they own (e.g. under `%USERPROFILE%`). For folders owned by `SYSTEM`, `TrustedInstaller`, or other users, Sandy must be run as Administrator.

---

## Cleanup &amp; Crash Resilience

Sandy never leaves system state dirty. Six resources are tracked and cleaned regardless of how the process exits:

| Resource | Created by | Persistence |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **ACL grants** | `[allow]` folder/file grants | `HKCU\Software\Sandy\Grants\<UUID>` (write-ahead SDDL) |
| **Registry persistence** | Grant write-ahead log | Same key (cleared with ACLs) |
| **Loopback exemption** | `localhost = true` | In-memory flag + `CheckNetIsolation.exe` |
| **AppContainer profile** | Container creation | OS-managed (`Sandy_<UUID>`) — unique per instance |
| **Scheduled task** | Crash safety net | Task Scheduler (`SandyCleanup`) |
| **WER keys** | `-a` or `-d` crash dumps | `HKCU\Software\Sandy\WER` (PID as value name) |

### Exit scenarios

| Scenario | ACLs | Loopback | AppContainer | Sched. Task | WER | Registry | Mechanism |
|----------|:----:|:--------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:---:|:--------:|-----------|
| **Clean exit** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `cleanup()` lambda in `RunSandboxed` |
| **Child crash** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Same — child exit doesn't affect Sandy |
| **Ctrl+C / close** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Console signal handler → `CleanupSandbox()` |
| **Sandy crash (SEH)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `__except` handler → `CleanupSandbox()` |
| **Power loss / taskkill** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Scheduled task at logon → `sandy.exe --cleanup` |

### How it works

1. **Write-ahead logging:** Before modifying any DACL, Sandy persists the original SDDL to `HKCU\Software\Sandy\Grants\<UUID>`. The subkey also stores `_pid` (for liveness checks) and `_container` (AppContainer profile name). WER exe names are stored in `HKCU\Software\Sandy\WER` with PID as value name. Both are written *before* the system state is modified.

2. **Scheduled task safety net:** A `SandyCleanup` scheduled task is created to run `sandy.exe --cleanup` at next logon. It only fires if Sandy didn't clean up normally (crash/power loss). Deleted on clean exit.

3. **Multi-instance safety:** Each instance generates a UUID at startup and creates its own AppContainer profile (`Sandy_<UUID>`) with a unique SID. This means concurrent instances have completely independent file grants that cannot interfere with each other. On exit, an instance only revokes its own ACEs; paths still granted by other live instances are preserved. Registry subkeys use the UUID as the key name, with stored PID for liveness checks during `--cleanup`.

   > **For agents and automation:** Multiple Sandy instances can safely run concurrently with overlapping folder grants. Each instance's sandbox is fully isolated. Use `--status` to inspect active instances and `--cleanup` to clear any stale state.

4. **Stale entry warning:** On startup, Sandy checks for leftover registry entries and warns:
   ```
   [Sandy] WARNING: Stale registry entries detected from a previous crashed run.
           Grants: HKCU\Software\Sandy\Grants   WER: HKCU\Software\Sandy\WER
           Run 'sandy.exe --cleanup' to restore original state.
           If another sandy instance is running, its entries are expected.
   ```

5. **Explicit cleanup only:** Stale state restoration (ACL reverts, WER key removal, AppContainer profile deletion) is performed exclusively by `sandy.exe --cleanup` — never during normal startup. Cleanup only processes entries from dead PIDs, preserving live instances' grants.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If Sandy is killed via `taskkill /F` or power is lost, run `sandy.exe --cleanup` manually or wait for the next logon (the scheduled task handles it automatically).
