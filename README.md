## What is Sandy?

Sandy launches executables inside a kernel-enforced Windows sandbox. Two isolation modes are supported: [AppContainer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/appcontainer-isolation) (the same technology used by UWP apps and Edge) and **Restricted Token** (restricting SIDs with configurable integrity level). By default, sandboxed processes **cannot** access user files, the network, or write to system directories.

No VMs, Docker, WSL, or Hyper-V needed — just a single native executable. Agentic AI workflows, automation scripts, and tool-use pipelines need to execute code, but running them with full user privileges is reckless and spinning up a full sandbox for every script is heavyweight. Sandy is the configurable middle ground: lean, unprivileged sandboxing where you define exactly which folders, files, and network access the process gets — everything else is blocked at the kernel level.

### Key Features

- 🔒 **Dual sandbox modes** — AppContainer or Restricted Token with configurable integrity
- 📁 **Granular access control** — read, write, execute, append, delete, or full access per file or folder
- 🌐 **Network control** — internet, LAN, and localhost independently configurable
- 🛡️ **Locked down by default** — all access is opt-in via config
- ⏱️ **Resource limits** — timeout, memory cap, and process count limits
- 📝 **Audit logging** — session logs, Procmon-based denial auditing, and crash dumps
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — single native executable, no runtime needed

## Usage

```
sandy.exe -c <config.toml> [-l <logfile>] [-a <auditlog>] [-q] -x <executable> [args...]
sandy.exe -s "<toml>"      [-l <logfile>] [-a <auditlog>] [-q] -x <executable> [args...]
sandy.exe -p <report>       -x <executable> [args...]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c <path>`, `--config <path>` | Path to TOML config file |
| `-s <toml>`, `--string <toml>` | Inline TOML config string (alternative to `-c`) |
| `-l <path>`, `--log <path>` | Session log (config, output, exit code) |
| `-a <path>`, `--audit <path>` | Audit log of denied resource access (requires Procmon + admin) |
| `-p <path>`, `--profile <path>` | Profile process for sandbox feasibility (requires Procmon + admin) |

## Config File

All sandbox behavior is controlled by a TOML config. Every config **must** include a `[sandbox]` section declaring the token mode. Mode-specific settings are validated — using a flag meant for the other mode is an error.

See [`sandy_config.toml`](sandy_config.toml) for the default template, [`sandy_config_appcontainer.toml`](sandy_config_appcontainer.toml) and [`sandy_config_restricted.toml`](sandy_config_restricted.toml) for mode-specific templates.

### `[sandbox]` — Mode selection *(mandatory)*

```toml
[sandbox]
token = "appcontainer"    # or "restricted"
integrity = "low"         # restricted only: "low" (default) or "medium"
```

| Key | Values | Modes | Description |
|-----|--------|-------|-------------|
| `token` | `"appcontainer"`, `"restricted"` | both | Sandbox isolation model *(required)* |
| `integrity` | `"low"`, `"medium"` | restricted | Integrity level · `"low"` = strongest isolation, `"medium"` = wider app compatibility |

### `[access]` — File and folder grants

Grant the sandboxed process access to specific files or folders. Paths are recursive for directories.

```toml
[access]
read    = ['C:\data\config.json', 'C:\Python314']
write   = ['C:\logs\agent.log', 'C:\temp\output']
execute = ['C:\tools\bin']
append  = ['C:\logs\audit.log']
delete  = ['C:\temp\scratch']
all     = ['C:\workspace']
```

| Key | Permission granted |
|-----|--------------------|
| `read` | Read files, list directories |
| `write` | Create and modify files |
| `execute` | Execute (no read) |
| `append` | Append only (no overwrite, no read) |
| `delete` | Delete only |
| `all` | Full access (read + write + execute + delete) |

### `[allow]` — Opt-in permissions

Everything is blocked unless set to `true`. Settings are validated against the active mode.

```toml
[allow]
system_dirs    = true    # appcontainer only
network        = true    # appcontainer only
localhost      = true    # appcontainer only (admin required)
lan            = true    # appcontainer only
named_pipes    = true    # restricted only
stdin          = false   # both modes
clipboard_read  = false  # both modes (default: true)
clipboard_write = false  # both modes (default: true)
child_processes = false  # both modes (default: true)
```

| Key | Modes | Default | Description |
|-----|-------|---------|-------------|
| `system_dirs` | appcontainer | `false` | Read access to `C:\Windows`, `Program Files` |
| `network` | appcontainer | `false` | Outbound internet access |
| `localhost` | appcontainer | `false` | Loopback connections (requires admin) |
| `lan` | appcontainer | `false` | Local network access |
| `named_pipes` | restricted | `false` | Named pipe creation (`CreateNamedPipeW`) |
| `stdin` | both | `true` | Inherit stdin (set `false` to redirect to NUL) |
| `clipboard_read` | both | `true` | Allow reading from the clipboard |
| `clipboard_write` | both | `true` | Allow writing to the clipboard |
| `child_processes` | both | `true` | Allow spawning child processes (kernel-enforced) |

#### What `system_dirs` exposes (AppContainer only)

Enables the `ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES` group, granting **read-only** access to:

| Path | Access |
|------|--------|
| `C:\Windows`, `System32`, `SysWOW64` | ✅ read |
| `C:\Program Files`, `Program Files (x86)` | ✅ read |
| `C:\Windows\Temp`, `ProgramData`, `C:\Users` | ❌ blocked |
| User profile (Desktop, Documents, Downloads) | ❌ blocked |

> [!TIP]
> Python's Windows installer sets `ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES` on its install directory. With `system_dirs = true`, the Python folder is readable without an explicit `[access]` entry.

### `[registry]` — Registry key grants *(restricted only)*

Grant read or write access to specific registry keys. Most keys under `HKLM\Software` and `HKCU` are already readable by default via `BUILTIN\Users`.

```toml
[registry]
read  = ['HKCU\Software\MyApp']
write = ['HKCU\Software\MyApp\Settings']
```

> [!NOTE]
> `[registry]` is not available in AppContainer mode — AppContainer provides a fixed private registry hive automatically.

### `[environment]` — Environment variables

Control which environment variables the sandboxed process inherits.

```toml
[environment]
inherit = false
pass = ['PATH', 'PYTHONPATH', 'HOME']
```

When `inherit = false`, the following essential Windows vars are always passed:

| Category | Variables |
|----------|-----------|
| System | `SYSTEMROOT`, `SYSTEMDRIVE`, `WINDIR`, `OS` |
| Temp | `TEMP`, `TMP` |
| Shell | `COMSPEC`, `PATHEXT` |
| User dirs | `LOCALAPPDATA`, `APPDATA`, `USERPROFILE`, `HOMEDRIVE`, `HOMEPATH` |
| Hardware | `PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE`, `NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` |

### `[limit]` — Resource constraints

```toml
[limit]
timeout = 300       # kill process after N seconds
memory = 4096       # max memory in MB
processes = 10      # max concurrent child processes
```

## Sandbox Modes

**🔒** = fundamental OS limitation &nbsp;&nbsp; **→** = fixed (not configurable) &nbsp;&nbsp; **⚙️** = configurable via TOML

| Aspect | AppContainer | Restricted Token |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Integrity level** | → Low (OS-enforced) | ⚙️ `integrity` · `"low"` or `"medium"` (default: `"low"`) |
| **Named pipes** | 🔒 Blocked (kernel prohibits at Low IL) | ⚙️ `named_pipes` · default: blocked |
| **Network** | ⚙️ `network` `localhost` `lan` · default: blocked | 🔒 Unrestricted (no capability model) |
| **Object namespace** | 🔒 Isolated (private per-container namespace) | 🔒 Shared (global namespace) |
| **System dirs** (Windows, Program Files) | ⚙️ `system_dirs` · default: blocked | → Always readable (Users SID in restricting list) |
| **User profile** (Desktop, Documents, etc.) | → Blocked (AppContainer SID excluded) | → Blocked at `"low"` IL · accessible at `"medium"` |
| **Registry** | → Private hive (reads OK, writes to HKLM/HKCU blocked) | ⚙️ `[registry]` `read`/`write` · most keys readable by default |
| **COM/RPC servers** | 🔒 Most reject AppContainer callers | → Accessible |
| **Process identity** | 🔒 AppContainer SID (different principal) | → User SID (same principal, restricted) |
| **Elevation** | 🔒 Cannot escalate | 🔒 Cannot escalate |
| **Scheduled tasks** | 🔒 Blocked (COM rejected) | 🔒 Blocked at `"low"` IL · → allowed at `"medium"` |
| **Window messages (UIPI)** | 🔒 Blocked (Low IL) | 🔒 Blocked at `"low"` IL · → allowed at `"medium"` |
| **Clipboard** | ⚙️ `clipboard_read` `clipboard_write` · default: allowed | ⚙️ `clipboard_read` `clipboard_write` · default: allowed |
| **Child processes** | ⚙️ `child_processes` · default: allowed | ⚙️ `child_processes` · default: allowed |
| **File/folder grants** | ⚙️ `[access]` | ⚙️ `[access]` |
| **Privilege stripping** | → All stripped | → All stripped except `SeChangeNotifyPrivilege` |
| **Environment** | ⚙️ `[environment]` | ⚙️ `[environment]` |
| **Resource limits** | ⚙️ `[limit]` | ⚙️ `[limit]` |
| **Stdin** | ⚙️ `stdin` · default: inherited | ⚙️ `stdin` · default: inherited |

> [!NOTE]
> **Integrity × compatibility trade-off** (restricted mode only):

| | Low | Medium |
|---|---|---|
| **Write to user files** | ❌ Blocked by mandatory IL | ✅ Allowed (User SID matches) |
| **DLL/API set resolution** | ❌ Breaks some apps (Python 3.14+) | ✅ Works |
| **User profile access** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Accessible |
| **Isolation layers** | 2 (SIDs + integrity) | 1 (SIDs only) |
| **System dir reads** | ✅ Always readable | ✅ Always readable |
| **System dir writes** | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **Named pipes** | ⚙️ Configurable | ⚙️ Configurable |
| **Scheduled tasks** | ❌ Blocked (Low IL) | ✅ Allowed |
| **Window messages (UIPI)** | ❌ Blocked (Low IL) | ✅ Allowed |
| **Clipboard** | ⚙️ Configurable | ⚙️ Configurable |
| **Child processes** | ⚙️ Configurable | ⚙️ Configurable |
| **Network** | ✅ Unrestricted | ✅ Unrestricted |

**Use AppContainer** when you need network isolation and don't require named pipes or COM.
**Use Restricted Token** when the sandboxed app needs named pipes (Flutter, Chromium, Mojo) or COM/RPC.

### Examples

AppContainer with network access:

```toml
[sandbox]
token = "appcontainer"

[access]
read = ['C:\Python314', 'C:\projects\my_agent']
all = ['C:\workspace']

[allow]
system_dirs = true
network = true
stdin = false

[environment]
inherit = false
pass = ['PATH']

[limit]
timeout = 300
memory = 2048
```

```
sandy.exe -c agent_config.toml -x C:\Python314\python.exe agent.py
```

Restricted Token with pipes and medium integrity:

```toml
[sandbox]
token = "restricted"
integrity = "medium"

[access]
read = ['C:\Python314', 'C:\projects\my_agent']
all = ['C:\workspace']

[allow]
named_pipes = true

[registry]
write = ['HKCU\Software\MyApp\Settings']

[limit]
timeout = 300
```

## Audit

The `-a` flag enables Procmon-based resource denial auditing. When a sandboxed process crashes or misbehaves, the audit log shows exactly which resources were denied.

```
sandy.exe -c config.toml -a audit.log -x myapp.exe
```

**Requirements:** [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) on PATH + admin privileges.

Sandy automatically launches Procmon in headless mode, captures all events during the child's lifetime, then parses the results into a filtered audit log containing only denials.

**What's captured:**

| Category | Events |
|----------|--------|
| FILE | File/folder open, read, write, delete denials |
| REG | Registry key/value access denials |
| NET | Network connection blocks |
| IMAGE | DLL/image load failures |
| PROCESS | Child process creation blocks |
| FILE | Named object (mutex, event, section) denials |



**Example audit log:**

```
[13:07:38.12] T:4520   FILE    ACCESS DENIED       C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll
[13:07:38.34] T:4520   REG     ACCESS DENIED       HKLM\Software\MyApp
[13:07:38.51] T:4520   FILE    NAME NOT FOUND      api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll

=== Process Tree ===
python.exe  PID:4520  exit:0xC0000022  CRASHED
  +- worker.exe  PID:6012  exit:0  OK

=== Summary: 47 unique events, 38 FILE, 3 REG, 4 NET, 2 IMAGE ===

=== Repeated (x count) ===
  x23  FILE    ACCESS DENIED       C:\Windows\System32
```

> [!NOTE]
> The audit log is generated after the child process exits (post-mortem). Events are deduplicated — repeated denials for the same path/result appear once with a repeat count.

---

## Profile

The `-p` flag runs a process **unsandboxed** under [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon), analyzes its resource usage, and generates a compatibility report with a suggested TOML config.

```
sandy.exe -p report.txt -x myapp.exe [args...]
```

**Requirements:** [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) on PATH + admin privileges.

Use profile mode **before** sandboxing an unfamiliar application. It answers:

- **Can this process be sandboxed at all?** (detects HKLM writes, system dir writes)
- **Which sandbox mode works?** (AppContainer, Restricted Low, Restricted Medium)
- **What config is needed?** (read paths, write paths, network, system_dirs, etc.)

**What's analyzed:**

| Category | Detection |
|----------|-----------|
| File reads | Directories the process reads from (collapsed to parent paths) |
| File writes | Directories the process writes to, temp dir usage |
| System writes | Writes to `C:\Windows` or `C:\Program Files` (blocks all modes) |
| User profile writes | Writes to `C:\Users\*` — blocks Restricted Low |
| Registry | HKLM writes (blocks all modes), HKCU writes |
| Network | TCP/UDP connections, localhost, DNS lookups |
| Named pipes | Pipe creation (requires Restricted mode) |
| DLL loading | System DLL dependencies (`system_dirs` detection) |
| Child processes | Process tree tracking |

**Example report:**

```
=== Sandy Profile Report ===
Executable: C:\Python314\python.exe
Exit code:  0 (0x00000000) OK
Events:     3444 total, 2437 file, 1006 reg

--- Verdict ---
Sandboxable:     YES
AppContainer:    YES (recommended)
Restricted Low:  YES
Restricted Med:  YES

--- Required Config ---
  [access] read:
    C:\Users
    C:\repos\myproject
  [access] write:
    C:\Users\H\AppData\Local\Temp
  system_dirs = true

--- Suggested TOML Config ---
[sandbox]
token = "appcontainer"

[access]
read = ['C:\Users', 'C:\repos\myproject']
write = ['C:\Users\H\AppData\Local\Temp']

[allow]
system_dirs = true
```

> [!NOTE]
> Profile mode captures events using a Procmon include filter for the target process name. For accurate results, avoid running other instances of the same executable during profiling. Subdirectories are automatically collapsed to their common parent.

---

## Notes

> [!WARNING]
> **AppContainer: strict by default.** Sandy blocks access to system folders (`C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`) unless `system_dirs = true` is set in `[allow]`. Most executables need system DLLs to run, so the sample config ships with `system_dirs` enabled. In Restricted Token mode, system directories are always readable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Localhost access** (AppContainer only) requires administrator privileges. Sandy uses `CheckNetIsolation.exe` to manage the loopback exemption. If running without elevation, Sandy prints a warning and continues (localhost will remain blocked).

> [!NOTE]
> **Sandy runs without elevation in most cases.** It modifies folder ACLs to grant the sandbox access, which requires `WRITE_DAC` permission on each configured folder. Users have this permission on folders they own (e.g. under `%USERPROFILE%`). For folders owned by `SYSTEM`, `TrustedInstaller`, or other users, Sandy must be run as Administrator.
